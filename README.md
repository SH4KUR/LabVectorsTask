# LabVectorsTask

Objective: To implement the calculation of conditional arithmetic expressions, assuming that a, b and x are one-dimensional dynamic vectors containing integer elements of type int, length 1 <= n <= N = 1000.

These vectors must be objects of their (that is, user-defined) class. 

The class should provide several constructors and a destructor, as well as redefine the necessary operations for calculating logical and arithmetic expressions, according to the problem for its variant.

# Task

```
      1-b/a,    if a > b
x = { -10,      if a = b
      (a-52)/b, if a < b
```
